/// \file regexp.hpp
/// \brief A general purpose compile-time regexp that can matches strings at compile-time and runtime
/// A little disclaimer about this file, I wrote it back in 2012, just after learning C++ at school.
/// The file as since been sleeping on my hard disk drive, until I (re)-discover it in early 2016
/// I've cleaned it a bit, but as it works I don't have any reason to rewrite it.
///
/// It works by having the atom<> class associated to one or more character of the regexp string.
/// An atom can represent special characters (., $, ^, (, ), \, |, ...) which has then a special meaning
/// To an atom<> could be associated an operator (+, ?, *) than changes the matching behavior of the atom<>
/// If I don't clearly remember how the alternative atom works ( '|' ), the sub-expression ( '(' ) works by creating a
/// sub-expression terminated by a ')' (this way, you don't have to count opening and closing brackets and the expression
/// is terminated at the sight of a closing bracket).
